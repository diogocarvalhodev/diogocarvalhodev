### 📂 Engineering Case Studies (Proprietary Projects)

Since my work involves proprietary intellectual property and critical security systems, I cannot share the source code. However, I have documented the **architecture, challenges, and solutions** below:

#### 1️⃣ [Sentrio: Edge AI Surveillance System](./docs/sentrio-case-study.md)
* **The Challenge:** Automating threat detection in industrial zones without relying on human vigilance.
* **The Solution:** A microservices-based architecture using **YOLO (Computer Vision)** and **FastAPI** to process RTSP streams in real-time.
* **Tech:** Python, Docker, OpenCV, PostgreSQL.

#### 2️⃣ [Large-Scale Critical Monitoring (CCO)](./docs/cco-monitoring.md)
* **The Challenge:** Managing availability for **400+ distributed assets** (IoT/Cameras) with zero visibility on downtime.
* **The Solution:** Implementation of a full Observability Stack (Grafana/Prometheus) with automated telegram alerting.
* **Impact:** Drastic reduction in MTTR (Mean Time to Repair).
