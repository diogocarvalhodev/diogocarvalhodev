# Hi, I'm Diogo Carvalho 👋
### Computer Engineer | Critical Infrastructure & Reliability Engineering

Computer Engineer focused on designing and operating reliable systems in mission-critical environments. 

My experience bridges **Operational Technology (OT)** and **modern software engineering**, with hands-on work in large-scale infrastructure monitoring, Edge Computing, and distributed systems.

Currently working with monitoring and reliability of 400+ distributed critical assets, applying observability principles and automation to reduce operational risk and improve incident response.

🌍 Based in Brazil  
🚀 Focus Areas: Critical Infrastructure | Industrial Monitoring | Reliability Engineering | Edge Computing

## 📂 Engineering Case Studies

### 1️⃣ Sentrio - Edge NVR Core
**Problem:** Need for automated monitoring in environments with limited connectivity.  
**Solution:** Designed a containerized microservices architecture using YOLO (Computer Vision) and FastAPI to process RTSP streams locally (Edge-first approach).  
**Technologies:** Python, Docker, OpenCV.

### 2️⃣ Large-Scale Critical Asset Monitoring
**Context:** Operational responsibility over 400+ distributed critical assets.  
**Implementation:** Built an observability stack using Grafana and Prometheus with automated alerting integrations.  
**Result:** Improved visibility, reduced manual verification cycles, and accelerated incident response (MTTR reduction).
